# Smart City Scheduling - Graph Algorithms

A Java implementation of graph algorithms for task scheduling in smart city scenarios.

## Algorithms
- Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju's algorithm)
- Topological Sorting (Kahn's algorithm)
- Shortest/Longest Paths in Directed Acyclic Graphs

## Build
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

## Test
